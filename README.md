# FOOD HUT

 Food Hut is a website for a multivendor food platform where different food vendors can showcase and sell their products to customers. The website aims to provide a convenient and easy-to-use platform for both vendors and customers to buy and sell a variety of food items. It's designed for anyone who loves good food and wants to try out different cuisines from different vendors. Customers can browse through the website, view the vendors' menus, place orders, and make secure payments. Vendors, on the other hand, can register on the platform, upload their products, manage their inventory, and receive payments for their sales.
